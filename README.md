# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
I have been tasked to complete an audit of a local election for a Colorado Board of Elections employee. To complete this task I have used the programmati tools of Python, Visual Studio Code, and Git.

To complete this audit/project I have done the following:
1. Calculated the total number of votes casted.
2. Compiled a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Cacluated the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculated kthe percentage of votes eached candidate received.
5. Determined the winner of the electioned based on the popular vote.

## Resources

- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:

- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of the total votes.
